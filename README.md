**Note about the map service**

<p>Maps are based on Google Maps service. To create maps, you must request a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key" target="_blank">Google Map API KEY</a>, then copy/paste the key
when creating the map with AdaptLearning Authoring tool.</p>
<p>Google Maps service has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/" target="_blank">generous free plan</a>, under a certain volume of map drawings and for free courses. Please refer to Google Maps free plan to make sure that
 fits your needs.</p>
 

**Support the development**
<p>
If you like this component and you would like to adopt other kind of interactive maps on your course 
(like <a href="http://openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a>), or having more complex interactions
on the maps,
please consider to support the development of new map components.
